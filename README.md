# Olivier Thibault 
# Self-taught
Aspiring Full-Stack web/software developer!
This is the first repository/page, I tried to build myself all from scracth using GitHub, Copilot and other resources to teach myself the basics of web/software developement.
# Pre-injury
Since graduating HighSchool in June of 2011. I always aspired to become a Red Seal journeyman automtive technician, but in June of 2022 a work injury happened which lead me to undergo 2 knee arthroscopies, countless hours of Physiotheraphy. Ultimately in the Spring of 2025 a physical evaluation took place which clearly showed I wasn't able to perform the minimum requirements to continue in the field of work that I always saw myself doing. 
# New career 
Which brings us to now, 3 years and a bit since the date of accident. After many weeks, months of reflections and counteless hours of conversation with my very supportive wife. What career could i get into that would give me a similar drive than the automotive world did ? That's when the idea of becoming a Full stack web developer could be a great opportunity, from aspiring automotive technician to now being an aspiring internet technician.
From self-teaching to career ready!
Of course I didn't learn everything alone, I attended a 6 week booth camp offered through an  organization called Lighthouse Labs as well as the Full-Stack web developer Diploma from the University of Alberta in Edmonton were the biggest resources that were made available to me.
